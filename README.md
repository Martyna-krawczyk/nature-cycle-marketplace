## Natu[re]Cycle
NatureCycle is an application which allows users to list their discarded kids bikes for sale. It is a traditional marketplace-style application with user registration, image uploads and a Stripe payment gateway for processing of deposit payments.

## Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app
Kids grow out of their clothes, shoes and uniforms, however, as a parent, the biggest lump-sum expense associated with our kids' growth would have to be the regular replacement of their bicycles. 
Have you ever walked down a suburban street and seen a discarded kids bike on the nature strip?  They're usually lying there for a good week before someone picks them up and this is where they deteriorate the most, making them difficult to re-home.

## Why is it a problem that needs solving?
This application has been developed to:
- make it easier to re-home unwanted bikes
- get kids onto the right sized bike, sooner
- get bikes off the nature strip
- makes bikes affordable to families in financial hardship
- reduce the incidence of discarded bikes in landfill.
